Tips for equalization. By frequency, by instrument with a glossary.
This article will still get updated. (Last update: `Thursday, April 20th 2017`)

### EQ Frequency Breakdown

- **30Hz** / Virtually undetectable, you can safely cut these frequencies.
- **40-60Hz** / Sub bass Freque­ncies. "Feel" only.
- **60-200Hz** / Add for tom "boom". Cut to decrease bass "boom".
- **80Hz** / Boost for the kick drum lower end to cut through the mix. Notch most other instruments here. Rolling off the electric guitar here is advisables.
- **80-200Hz** / Boost bass instruments for presence. Boost will add warmth and fullness to guitars, vocals and horns.
- **100Hz-4kHz** / Scooping/notching instruments here will provide room in the mix.
- **<=120Hz** / Add for warmth. Too much will sound muddy.
- **120-125Hz** / Top of the range for most subwoofers. Also the low end of music such as kick drums and bass guitar. Bottom end of acoustic guitar and piano. Add for warmth.
- **120-600Hz** / Boost for strong vocal presence. Causes problems with vocal resonance and fatiguing.
- **200Hz** / Slight boost for depth. Cut to reduce muddiness. This is a good area to get the "gong" out of cymbals.
- **240Hz** / Boost to fatten the snare. Boost acoustic guitars slightly to add fullness. Scoop vocal here if muddy. Notch filter here can add thump to a kick drum.
- **350-400Hz** / Cut to remove the "cardboard" sound of drums - Notch the bass guitar a little bit to reduce presence.
- **0.6-3kHz** / Provides presence, but are hard in nature. Good for rock.
- **800Hz** / Boost the bass guitar for punch. Cut the electric guitar to remove the "cheap" sound.
- **2-4kHz** / In this area you can emphasize the "smack" of the kick's beater.
- **2.5kHz** / Good for adding to a dirty guitar for some real sizzle. Boost this area for bass guitar if using the pop/slap style.
- **2.5-5kHz** / Boost for clarity with an acoustic guitar and piano.
- **3-7kHz** / This is the area where vocal sibilance resides. Boost slightly to add sense of "volume" It also adds a harshness that is partic­ularly fatiguing. Add warmth without loss of clarity by attenu­ating this region a bit.
- **4kHz** / Boost vocal here for presence.
- **4-9kHz** / Bright­ness, presence, defini­tion, sibilance, high frequency distortion.
- **4.5kHz** / Extremely tiring to the ears, add a slight notch here.
- **5kHz** / Add a crisp, sharp "­cra­ck" to the snare. Also a good place to add some attack to the toms. Cut on background parts to make them sink in to the back a bit.
- **>=7kHz** / Add for the sense of quality and accuracy for cymbals. Too much output will come off as lacking defini­tion. Cut vocals to decrease sibilance.
- **8-12kHz** / Cut or Boost to adjust brightness for cymbals and acoustic guitar.
- **9-15kHz** / Adding will give sparkle, shimmer, bring out details. Cutting will smooth out harshness and darken the mix.
- **10kHz** / Boost to add "­air­" and clarity to acoustic instru­ments.

### EQ Instrument Breakdown

- **Vocals** / presence (5 kHz), sibilance (7.5 ‐ 10 kHz), boom (200 ‐ 240 kHz), fullness (120 Hz)
- **Electric Guitar** / fullness (240 Hz), bite (2.5 kHz), air / sizzle (8 kHz)
- **Bass Guitar** / bottom (60 ‐ 80 Hz), attack (700 ‐ 1000 Hz), string noise (2.5 kHz)
- **Snare Drum** / fatness (240 Hz), crispness (5 kHz)
- **Kick Drum** / bottom (60 ‐ 80 Hz), slap (4 kHz)
- **Hi Hat & Cymbals** / sizzle (7.5 ‐ 10 kHz), clank (200 Hz)
- **Toms** / attack (5 kHz), fullness (120 ‐ 240 Hz)
- **Acoustic Guitar** / harshness / bite (2 kHz), boom (120 ‐ 200 Hz), cut (7 ‐ 10 kHz)

### EQ Glosary

- **Attenuation** / the reduction of a signal level
- **Band** / range of frequencies
- **Boost** / selected frequency levels are amplified
- **Cut** / selected frequency are attenuated
- **Presence** / increasing causes the sounds of voices and such instruments seem more "present"
- **Q** / describes the shape of the EQ curve (higher Q = narrower range, lower Q = wider range)
- **Sibilance** / refers to the hissing "s","sh","z", or "zh", sound of the human voice
- **Warmth** / sound where the bass and low mid frequencies have depth and where the high frequencies are smooth sounding opposed to aggressive or fatiguing
